Introduction
------------

AresEd is a high-level and fully featured 3D game creation suite. It is Free
and Open Source. When it is finished you will be able to make full 3D games
without writing any code (although a fallback to the python scripting
language will be provided). AresEd is based on the Crystal Space 3D engine
and on Crystal Entity Layer for game logic. It is also based on WX for the
user interface and Bullet for physics. The editor is fully physics based and
shows a realtime preview of the game world.
